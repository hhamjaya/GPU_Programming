# GPU_Programming

## Course description:

Almost all computing platforms today, ranging from mobile devices to laptops to supercomputers, are heterogeneous, containing not only several CPU cores but also graphics processing units GPUs for high graphics throughput and energy efficiency. The GPUs are also capable of general purpose computing, offering the user a computational resource on par with tens of CPU cores. However, using GPUs efficiently is nontrivial. While the computing community and the hardware vendors build their own tools and libraries to ease the use of these systems, high performance application development requires knowledge about relatively low-level programming and the underlying hardware architecture.

GPUs, and in particular Cuda based GPUs, have become the de facto standard hardware accelerators among the top tier supercomputers in the world. The ability to use GPUs for general purpose computing has opened up the possibility to speed up calculations by up to two orders of magnitude. Recently the Finnish supercomputer center CSC (www.csc.fi) has acquired Lumi, a 200 million â‚¬ joint European supercomputer with 0.4 EFLOP/s peak performance.

This course is designed for students to learn the essence of CUDA programming and how to use CUDA to achieve substantial speed ups compared to CPUs.
The course is application oriented and introduces the necessary knowledge of the underlying GPU architecture and the programming model in order to start implementing the course exercise work. The lectures cover the concept of data parallel execution models, GPU memory models, techniques to reduce bandwidth consumption, high level GPU architecture, and CUDA application programming interfaces APIs. In order to pass this course, participants are asked to design, implement, run and document their exercise CUDA work on calculating a statistical measure for the galaxy distribution in the universe .
There is no strict deadline for the documentation, but it would be a good idea to finish your work by the end of the year.

## Recommended background:

Programming experience in C/C++, although some have started with very little C knowledge.
